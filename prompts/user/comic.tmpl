Estimate the fair market value of the following comic book based on recent sales, market trends, and industry standards:
Comic Book: <TMPL_VAR TITLE>
<TMPL_IF VOLUME>Volume: <TMPL_VAR VOLUME></TMPL_IF>
Issue #: <TMPL_VAR ISSUE_NUM>
Year: <TMPL_VAR YEAR>
Grade: <TMPL_VAR GRADE> <TMPL_VAR GRADE_NUMBER>

Consider that the magazine is not professional graded (or "slabbed") and is a raw collectible.

Determine the most reliable price range, then return only the midpoint value in USD, formatted as a number with two decimal places (e.g., 1300.00).
